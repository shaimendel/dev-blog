# About me

![me](/docs/assets/me.jpeg)

Hi all!
I am Shai :)

I have worked in various engineering positions throughout the last 10 years:<br>
- spent all of my professional years in the info sec and cyber industries
- in the last 3 years I am an engineering team lead
- I am also a ballistic missile, or טיל בליסטי

Currently working as an engineering team lead in [Snyk](https://snyk.io).

When I am not coding you can probably find me playing the piano, running in the streets or just having some "quality" Netflix time.
